 * This is to bridge the gap between ConfigFile which needs Action and RawConfigFile which has to be available in NCPCompat. <br>
 * Aim is not speed of execution but providing a way of accessing all configs to set properties from within compatibility modules.
 * <br>
 * This might be seen as a refactoring/structuring stage, leading to putting actions to NCPCompat as well. RawConfigFile might get changed.
